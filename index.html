            <h3>What is the Circle of Fifths?</h3>

            <p>According to Wikipedia, the Circle of Fifths is:</p>

            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths">
            In music theory, the circle of fifths (or circle of fourths) is the relationship among the 12 tones of the chromatic scale, their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys.
            </blockquote>

            <p>The Circle of Fifths is a concept in music theory that allows people to visualize all of the diatonic scales of western music theory in a circle. It looks something like this:</p>

            <img  src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg/1024px-Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg.png" alt="Circle of Fifths" max-height="300" max-width="300" class="center">

            <p>This probably looks pretty daunting, but don't worry! We will break it down and you will get it in no time!</p>
              
            <a id="The_Major_Scale"><p>First, let's focus on the red letters on the outside of the circle. These letters represent each major scale. C major is at the top with no sharps or flats in the key signature. If you don't know what a key signature is, we recommend reading <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/key-signature">this article.</a></p></a>

            <h3>The Major Scale</h3>

            <p>To figure out how to navigate this circle, we must first learn about the major scale.  The major scale consists of a sequence of intervals between notes like so:</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 20%">whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half</p>
            <audio controls style="margin-left: 20%">
              <source src="c-major-scale-on-bass-clef.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
              Your browser does not support the audio element.
            </audio>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>To better picture this, on the image of the keyboard below, start at C and trace your way up the scale using the intervals stated above. From C, you go up a whole step to D, then up another whole step to E, then a half step to F and so on.  Try it!</p>

            <img src="https://cdn.instructables.com/FEP/TIWZ/GITHPY3O/FEPTIWZGITHPY3O.LARGE.gif?auto=webp&frame=1">

            <a id="back_to_circle"><p>Notice that C major hits all of the white keys and no black keys indicating that C has no sharps or flats. We can use this interval sequence to create a major scale that starts on any key.</p></a>

            <h3>Back to the circle</h3>
            <p>If you start at C on a piano and count up five notes of the major scale, you will land on G.  This is what is known as a fifth. G is the fifth of C, D is the fifth of G and so on.  If you look back at our circle, you can see that each red letter moving right from C is the fifth of the letter to its left.</p>

            <p>Now look at the key signatures beside the red letters and you will see that each key signature has one more sharp than the previous key. C has zero sharps, G has one sharp, D has two sharps etc. This is notated next the each key in the Circle of Fifths above.</p>

            <p>Now, if we start at C again and go leftwards around the cirlce, there are different letters in red.  Each letter, in this case, is a fifth below the previous letter instead of a fifth above. Go back to the keyboard, start at the high C and count five notes to the left in the major scale.  You will end up in the key of F.</p>

            <img src="https://cdn.instructables.com/FEP/TIWZ/GITHPY3O/FEPTIWZGITHPY3O.LARGE.gif?auto=webp&frame=1">

            <a id="The_Minor_Scale"><p>Also notice that the amount of flats are increasing as you move along the left side of the cirle from C. C has zero flats, F has one flat, Bb has 2 flats and so on goin all the way up to Cb.</p></a>

            <h3>The Minor Scale</h3>

            <p>Another thing you may have noticed are the green letters inside the circle. These are the major keys corresponding minor key.  For example, we already know that C major contains all of the white keys on a piano.  If we move down one and one half steps to A, and play all the white keys up to the octave of A, we will have the A minor scale. The intervals are thus:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p style="margin-left: 20%">whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole</p>
            <audio controls style="margin-left: 20%">
              <source src="a-minor-scale-on-bass-clef.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
              Your browser does not support the audio element.
            </audio>

            <a id="Practical_Applications"><p>As you can see, the Circle of Fifths includes all of the major and minor scales used in western music.</p></a>

            <h3>Practical Applications</h3>

            <p>I know what you're thinking: "Well, all that's great, but when am I ever going to use this information?" Although the Circle of Fifths can seem like a bunch of useless information, there are ways to put it to use.</p>

            <p>For example, let's say that you want to become a composer.  It would be very hard to write music for others to play if you don't know the key signature. Look no further than the Circle of Fifths!</p>

            <p>Here's another even more practical example: Let's say you want to write a song but have no idea where to begin.  You know a few chords on the guitar but do not know how to write a chord progression. The Circle of Fifths can help you with that as well! Check out the video below where a guitarists explains how to do just that:</p>

            <br>

            <p>That concludes our lesson on the Circle of Fifths. Hopefully you learned something new! Come back soon!</p>
